# AutoComplete

## AutoComplete?
There are many ways to suggest search words to users, and auto-complete is a popular way to do it.
This problem inspired me during one of the tech company interviews I had.
One simple way to implement autocomplete is using a trie, but then it becomes space inefficient to encode every character in the dictionary into a tree. Maybe [Generalized Suffix Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_suffix_tree) and [ternary search tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search_tree) can be used.
